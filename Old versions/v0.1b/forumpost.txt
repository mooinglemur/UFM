Being a developer from de early 90ths qBasic, QuickBasic and PowerBasic where my 'lowlevel' languages. With the x16 I thought it was time to try Assembler. A bit of a struggle at first, but it's comming along quite well.

As probably the most used software for any system is a good file manager, I thought: recreating my favorite one from last century makes sense. So hereby, I present to you the first testable version of Ultimate File Manager for x16, a Norton Commander clone.

Instructions:
- copy the content of the zip-file to the root (launch won't work otherwise)
- load fm.prg and run it
- use TAB to switch between windows, arrows to move the pointer, enter on a directory to CD or on a program to execute

Features:
- split window browsing through files and directories
- Basic filemanagement functions: copy, rename, move, delete, create directory
- For coping the DOS"C:..." command is not used as it is currently unsupported in the emulator. So I made my own.
- Support for long file names
- Launch tokenized basic files and assembly files AND return to Ultimate File Manager automaticly when program exited



Current limitations:
- Overwriting files is not yet possible
- Only the first 255 files of a directory are being listed
- Launch and return to UFM only supported for executables less then +-30kb and/or programs that do not use memory region $8000+
- Only 80 columns mode is supported
- Not possible to switch to other partition

Technical details:
- Developed with Visual Studio Code and ca65 assembler
- Using rambanks to store the file lists
- Outputting text directly to vram for fast scrolling/refreshing


Todo (in no particular order):
- Progress bar on file copy
- typing text searches in files list and moves pointer to correct file
- Type * to filter
- Overwrite on filecopy (with warning)
- optimize launch.prg to become much smaller
- integrate launch.prg into fm.prg
- show file size in bytes,kb,mb etc
- file edit with x16edit
- file viewer (text and hex)
- copy directory (including files and subdirectories)
- delete directory with all files and subdirectories)
- command shell to execute any DOS-command by typing it
- sorting files list on size and date
- SNES controller support
- support 40 columns
- size and performance optimization
- Save last directories, offset and row position on exit, read on load
- Make UFM work in other directory then root

Test version:
The current version is still under development. I would like others to test:
- on real hardware (until now it's only been tested in the emulator R45)
- launching (complex) tokenized basic files from UFM: if they run correctly and if UFM is opened after basic file is finished

Questions and Thoughts:
- How many files per directory list should be supported?
- How to overcome the LOAD"/subdir/ufm.prg" not able to find the starting directory problem
